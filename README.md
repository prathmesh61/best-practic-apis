# Designing a REST API 
involves careful consideration of folder structure to ensure it is organized, maintainable, and scalable. Here are some best practices for structuring a production-ready REST API:

# 1. Root Directory
src/: Main source code.
test/: Unit and integration tests.
config/: Configuration files (e.g., environment variables, database config).
scripts/: Scripts for automation, migrations, etc.
public/: Static files (if applicable).

# 2. src/ Directory
controllers/: Handle incoming requests, call services, and return responses.
services/: Business logic and interaction with data sources.
models/: Database models or schemas.
routes/: Define API routes and link them to controllers.
middlewares/: Middleware functions for request processing.
utils/: Utility functions and helpers.
validators/: Request validation logic.
loaders/: Modules to load and configure various aspects of the app (e.g., database connections).
